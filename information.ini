Each totem needs to be set at maximum range (50 foundations), this will provide you with the radius for your base. Nobody will be able to build within the totems area, so it is your tribes safe space to use however you like.\n\n2. Tribes can either use 2 totems together expanding on the main base, or utilise them separately making additional outpost on the map.\n\n3. Tribes MUST NOT build pillars or other buildings within the map, if you making traps, those have to be either picked up after use or left open for others to use.\n\n4. You are allowed to build additional teleporters on the map, as long as they are public and kept powered up.\n\n5. Admins keep the right to destroy any structures that they deem violating any of our rules.",
